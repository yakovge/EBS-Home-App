## ‚úÖ Development Guidelines
- Propose a clean, scalable **file/folder structure**
- Select and explain a state management strategy
- Set up Firebase services securely (start with placeholders)
- Define all types/interfaces (strict TypeScript)
- Follow OOP and SOLID principles 
- Ensure the code you build is modular
- Write in every file and folder what is the file's role in the project
- Avoid code duplication. Before you implement a functionality make sure it is not implemented elsewhere. If you find a functionality that need be implemented in two different places in the project, take the functionality out and use it whereever it needed. Be sure that every functionality is implemented in one and only one place in the project.

- Set up:
  - Navigation
  - i18n
  - Theming system

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints
- No breaking changes
- No `any` or untyped code
- No hardcoded Firebase keys or strings
- No unvalidated or unsafe logic

---

## üîÑ First Step
Start by outlining:
- Architecture plan  
- File structure  
- Implementation steps  

**Wait for confirmation before beginning actual development.**
