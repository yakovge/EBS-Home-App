### Test Commands

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest                          # Run all tests
pytest --cov=src               # Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_models.py    # Run specific test file

# Frontend tests

## 📋 Test Requirements

### Code Coverage Targets
- **Backend**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Frontend**: Minimum 75% coverage
- **Critical paths**: 95% coverage

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before deployment
- No decrease in coverage percentage
- Critical functionality must have comprehensive tests

### Test Data Management
- Use factories for test data generation
- Isolate tests with proper setup/teardown
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase, APIs)

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

Testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** - Run linting and basic tests
2. **Pull request checks** - Full test suite execution
3. **Deployment gates** - Tests must pass for deployment
4. **Nightly runs** - Full test suite with coverage reports

## 📈 Testing Metrics

Track these metrics for test effectiveness:

- **Coverage percentage** - Code coverage by tests
- **Test execution time** - Performance of test suite
- **Flaky test rate** - Tests that intermittently fail
- **Bug detection rate** - Issues caught by tests vs production

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Create first model unit tests
   - Establish coverage reporting

2. **Short-term (Weeks 2-3)**
   - Complete backend service tests
   - Add API integration tests
   - Set up frontend testing

3. **Medium-term (Weeks 4-6)**
   - Frontend component tests
   - E2E test setup
   - CI/CD integration

4. **Long-term (Ongoing)**
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Add performance tests
   - Regular test maintenance
